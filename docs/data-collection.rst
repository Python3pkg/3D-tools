Wanted: XYZRGB Pointclouds
==========================
In ``.ply`` format.  See `usage tips <usage>` for more details.


LIDAR
=====
If you have access to LIDAR hardware expensive enough to do full-colour
scans, you shouldn't need my help operating it.  Have fun, fortunate user!


Photogrammetry
==============
Photogrammetry, sometimes called Structure-from-Motion (SFM) is the technique
of reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple 2D images.

With a quadcopter to make landscape-scale scanning practical, this is a
viable and reasonably-priced option for research, forestry, and citizen
forest monitoring programmes.
